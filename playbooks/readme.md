## Systems support

The following systems are support for Cloud Native Stack:

- You have [NVIDIA-Certified Systems](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-deploy-on-premises/nvidia-certified-systems/index.html) with Mellanox CX NICs for x86-64 servers
- You have [NVIDIA Qualified Systems](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/data-center-gpus/qualified-system-catalog/?start=0&count=50&pageNumber=1&filters=eyJmaWx0ZXJzIjpbXSwic3ViRmlsdGVycyI6eyJwcm9jZXNzb3JUeXBlIjpbIkFSTS1UaHVuZGVyWDIiLCJBUk0tQWx0cmEiXX0sImNlcnRpZmllZEZpbHRlcnMiOnt9LCJwYXlsb2FkIjpbXX0=) for arm64 servers
  `NOTE:` For ARM systems, NVIDIA Network Operator is not supported yet.
- You have [NVIDIA Jetson Systems](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/)

To determine if your system qualifies as an NVIDIA Certified System, review the list of NVIDIA Certified Systems [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-deploy-on-premises/nvidia-certified-systems/index.html).

Please note that NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack is validated only on systems with the default kernel (not HWE).

### Installing the Ubuntu Operating System

These instructions require Ubuntu server please reference the [Ubuntu Server Installation Guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-install-ubuntu-server#1-overview).

### Installing JetPack for Jetson

JetPack (the Jetson SDK) is an on-demand all-in-one package that bundles developer software for the NVIDIAÂ® Jetson platform. There are two ways to install the JetPack

1. Use the SDK Manager installer to flash your Jetson Developer Kit with the latest OS image, install developer tools for both host PC and Developer Kit, and install the libraries and APIs, samples, and documentation needed to jump-start your development environment.

Follow the [instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/sdk-manager/install-with-sdkm-jetson/index.html) on how to install JetPack 5.0There are two ways to install the JetPack

Download the SDK Manager from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-sdk-manager)

2. Use the SD Card Image method to download the JetPack and load the OS image to external drive. For more information, please refer [flash using SD Card method](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-xavier-nx-devkit#prepare)

Install the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack stack by running the below command. "Skipping" in the ansible output refers to the Kubernetes cluster is up and running.

```bash
bash setup.sh install
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you trigger the installation on DGX System you need to click `Enter/Return` command when you see `Restarting Services`

#### Custom Configuration

By default Cloud Native Stack uses Google kubernetes apt repository, if you want to use any other kubernetes apt repository, please adjust the `k8s_apt_key` and `k8s_apt_repository` in `cns_values_<version>.yaml`.

Example:

```yaml
## Kubernetes apt resources
k8s_apt_key: "https://mirrors.aliyun.com/kubernetes/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg"
k8s_apt_repository: "deb https://mirrors.aliyun.com/kubernetes/apt/ kubernetes-xenial main"
k8s_registry: "registry.aliyuncs.com/google_containers"
```

##### Installation on CSP's

Cloud Native Stack can also support to install on CSP providers like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.

###### AWS

  Run below command to create AWS EKS cluster and install GPU Operator on EKS

  `NOTE:` Update the aws credentials in `files/aws_credentials` file before trigger the installation

  Update the AWS EKS values in the `cns_values_xx.yaml` before trigger the installation if needed.

  ```yaml
  ## AWS EKS values
  aws_region: us-east-2
  aws_cluster_name: cns-cluster-1
  aws_gpu_instance_type: g4dn.2xlarge
  ```

  ```bash
  bash setup.sh install eks
  ```

###### Azure

Run below command to create Azure AKS cluster and install GPU Operator on AKS

Update Azure Object ID's on `cns_values_xx.yaml` before trigger the installation

  ```yaml
  ## Azure AKS Values
  aks_cluster_name: cns-cluster-1
  aks_cluster_location: "West US 2"
  #https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/find-tenant-object-id
  azure_object_id: [""]
  ```

  ```bash
  bash setup.sh install aks
  ```

###### Google cloud

Run below command to create Google Cloud GKE cluster and install GPU Operator on GKE

Update the GKE Project ID `cns_values_xx.yaml` before trigger the installation

  ```yaml
  ## Google Cloud GKE Values
  #https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects
  gke_project_id:
  #https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#available
  gke_region: us-west1
  gke_node_zones: ["us-west1-b"]
  gke_cluster_name: cns-cluster-1
  ```

  ```bash
  bash setup.sh install gke
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> After GKE cluster created run the below command to use kubectl library

  ```bash
  source $HOME/cloud-native-stack/playbooks/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc
  ```

- If you encounter any destroy issue while uninstall you can try to run below commands which might help

  ```bash
  NS=`kubectl get ns |grep Terminating | awk 'NR==1 {print $1}'` && kubectl get namespace "$NS" -o json   | tr -d "\n" | sed "s/\"finalizers\": \[[^]]\+\]/\"finalizers\": []/"   | kubectl replace --raw /api/v1/namespaces/$NS/finalize -f -
  ```

  ```bash
  cd nvidia-terraform-modules/aks
  terraform destroy --auto-approve
  ```

##### Confidential Computing on CNS stack

You can install Cloud Native Stack with Confidentail Computing, run the below command to trigger the installation

You need add the `cns_values_xx.yaml` with BMC details like below

```yaml
# BMC Details for Confidential Computing
bmc_ip:
bmc_username:
bmc_password:
```

Run the below command to change the BIOS configuration and Install SNP Kernel for Confidential computing and system will eventually reboot

```bash
bash setup.sh install cc
```

Once it's rebooted then run the below command to install the Cloud Native Stack with Confidential Computing.

```bash
bash setup.sh install
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you want to re use the system It's recommended to re install the Operating system after used for Confidential Computing installation.
> - Currently playbooks supports only local system for confidential computing not supported for remote system installation.

### Monitoring on CNS

Deploy Prometheus/Grafana on Cloud Native Stack

You need to enable `monitoring` in the `cns_values_xx.yaml` like below

```
# Monitoring Stack Prometheus/Grafana with GPU Metrics
monitoring: no
```

Once stack is install access the Grafana with url `http://<node-ip>:32222` with credentials as `admin/cns-stack`

### Validation

Run the below command to check if the installed versions are match with predefined versions of the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack. Here' "Ignored" tasks refer to failed and "Changed/Ok" tasks refer to success.

Run the validation playbook after 5 minutes once completing the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack Installation. Depends on your internet speed, you need to wait more time.

```bash
bash setup.sh validate
```

### Upgrade

Cloud Native Stack can be support life cycle management with upgrade option. you can upgrade the current running stack version to next available version.

Upgrade option is available from one minor version to next minor version of CNS.

Example: Cloud Native Stack 8.0 can upgrade to 8.1 but 8.x can not upgrade to 9.x

### Uninstall

Run the below command to uninstall the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack. Tasks being "ignored" refers to no kubernetes cluster being available.

```bash
bash setup.sh uninstall
```

> [!NOTE]
> A list of older NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack versions (formerly known as Cloud Native Core) can be found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIAcloud-native-stack/blob/master/playbooks/older_versions/readme.md)
