# NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack 

## Introduction
NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack (CNS) is a collection of software to run cloud native workloads on NVIDIA GPUs. NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack is based on Ubuntu/RHEL, Kubernetes, Helm and the NVIDIA GPU and Network Operator.

Interested in deploying NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack? This repository has [install guides](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cloud-native-stack/tree/master/install-guides) for manual installations and [ansible playbooks](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cloud-native-stack/tree/master/playbooks) for automated installations.

Interested in a pre-provisioned NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack environment? [NVIDIA LaunchPad](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/launchpad/) provides pre-provisioned environments so that you can quickly get started.

## Objective

- CNS comes as a reference architecture that list all components that have been tested successfully together. the CNS reference architecture can be used as specification for production deployments.

- CNS also comes as installation guides and playbook that can be used to instantiate a quick K8s environment with NVIDIA operators. The CNS installation guides and playbook are intended only for test and PoC environments.

  Note: The K8s layer that CNS install guide or playbook deploys is basic (no HA for instance) and as such cannot be used for production. However all NVIDIA componants in CNS are fully operable in production environment. 

## Life Cycle

When NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack batch is released, the previous batch enters maintenance support and only receives patch release updates. All prior batches enter end-of-life (EOL) and are no longer supported and do not receive patch updates.

> Note: Upgrades are only supported from previous batch to latest batch.

#### Installation 

Run the below commands to clone the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack.

```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cloud-native-stack.git
cd cloud-native-stack/playbooks
```

Update the hosts file in playbooks directory with master and worker nodes(if you have) IP's with username and password like below

```
nano hosts

[master]
<master-IP> ansible_ssh_user=nvidia ansible_ssh_pass=nvidipass ansible_sudo_pass=nvidiapass ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
[nodes]
<worker-IP> ansible_ssh_user=nvidia ansible_ssh_pass=nvidiapass ansible_sudo_pass=nvidiapass ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```

Install the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack stack by running the below command. "Skipping" in the ansible output refers to the Kubernetes cluster is up and running.

```
bash setup.sh install
```
For more Information about customize the values, please refer [Installation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cloud-native-stack/tree/master/playbooks#installation)

# Topologies

- Cloud Native Stack allows to deploy:
    - 1 node with both control plane and worker functionalities
    - 1 control plane node and any number of worker nodes

`NOTE:` (Cloud Native Stack does not allow the deployment of several control plane nodes)
